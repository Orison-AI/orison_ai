Currently, many composite parts are produced by manually laying up sheets on complex molds. Composite sheet layup requires executing two main tasks: (1) grasping a sheet and (2) draping it on the mold. Automating the layup process requires automation of these two tasks. This paper is focused on the automation of the grasping task using robots. This requires an automated generation of grasp plans to enable robots to hold the sheet during the draping process. We present a simulation-based approach for determining robot grasp locations on the composite sheets. We also present an intervention controller that uses a real-time sheet tracking system during plan execution and can prevent failures. We demonstrate the performance of the developed system using a large complex part.\", \"year\": 2021, \"type_of_paper\": \"Unknown\", \"peer_reviews\": []}, {\"title\": \"Incorporating tool contact considerations in tool-path planning for robotic operations\", \"authors\": \"Prahar M Bhatt and Cheng Gong and Ariyan M Kabir and Rishi K Malhan and Brual C Shah and Satyandra K Gupta\", \"cited_by\": 9, \"abstract\": \"Tool-Path planning is the foundation for automating many manufacturing processes. Robotic manipulators are increasingly being considered to automate tasks that require complex tool motions. Robotic manipulators provide extra degrees of freedom and are more flexible than traditional automation technologies. However, a tool-path needs to be planned and given to the manipulator trajectory generator as input. The traditional tool-path planning considers the tool to have one contact point, known as the Tool Center Point (TCP). This underutilizes the available flexibility of the manipulator. To make use of the manipulator\\u2019s flexibility, multiple contact points or multiple TCPs can be considered. These tool contact considerations make the tool path planning problem complex and computationally challenging. In this paper, we present a novel tool path planning algorithm.

If robots are overloaded with work, then they will miss deadlines and force humans to take on extra work. This paper presents a framework for a robot to assess its own workload based on an initial goal assignment. The robot does this by generating task and motion plans and computing the probability of missing deadlines due to the possibility of delays in task execution. A branch and bound based search is used to generate task and motion plans by minimizing task execution effort. The robot presents a diverse set of task and motion plans to the humans to offer multiple different options. Humans can either approve a plan or provide guidance to reduce the workload by either relaxing deadlines or removing goal(s) assigned to the robots.\", \"year\": 2022, \"type_of_paper\": \"Unknown\", \"peer_reviews\": []}, {\"title\": \"Fast, accurate, and automated 3d reconstruction using a depth camera mounted on an industrial robot\", \"authors\": \"Rishi Malhan and Rex Jomy Joseph and Prahar M Bhatt and Brual Shah and Satyandra K Gupta\", \"cited_by\": 4, \"abstract\": \"3D reconstruction technology is used in a wide variety of applications.

Operational range of the sensor is limited and therefore the sensor needs to be moved around a large complex part in order to capture complete information. Robot arm or manipulators can provide the degrees of freedom needed to maneuver the sensor through the complex geometry. However, a robotic arm has a limited workspace as well and cannot cover large parts. Mobile base can enhance the capability of the robotic arm by adding mobility to the arm and carrying the arm around the part. Mobile base will need to relocate around the part during the process. Relocating the mobile base increases execution time and also introduces uncertainty in the localization as mobile base moves inaccurately. It is important to reduce the number of mobile base repositioning and reduce execution time and uncertainty.
