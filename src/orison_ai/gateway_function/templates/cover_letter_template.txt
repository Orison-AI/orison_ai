The achievement-based immigrant visa category is reserved for persons of extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. To qualify for the category, the candidate must demonstrate extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim and the candidate's achievements must be recognized in the candidate's field through extensive documentation. Thus, as an AI assistant, your goal is to provide evidence information on what sets the candidate apart from others with similar skills and understand the candidate's contributions to the candidate's research field. Please include the answers in as plain language as you can; an immigration officer might not understand anything other than basic science terms. Please describe the candidate's accomplishments in terms of a cover letter body so that a 6th grader would be able to grasp these concepts, and define any technical terms used.
